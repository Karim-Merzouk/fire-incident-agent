Human Resources
===============

The Human Resources Management (*hrm*) model describes employment-type
relationships between organisations and persons (as staff members, or
volunteers).

The *human resource* relation is also a proxy for the *Person Entity*
hierarchy, which is relevant for access authorization with hierarchical
realms.

The *hrm* module also implements a number of :doc:`business data models <../business/index>` (e.g.
the *training* model), which are not included in the ERD here.
