## 💬 **NATURAL LANGUAGE EXAMPLES**

### 🔍 **Query Examples You Can Try:**

```
🚨 Emergency Query: What's the current fire situation?
🚨 Emergency Query: Show me evacuation status
🚨 Emergency Query: Who are the evacuees?
🚨 Emergency Query: What resources do we have deployed?
🚨 Emergency Query: Which communities are threatened?
🚨 Emergency Query: How many people are affected?
🚨 Emergency Query: What's the damage assessment?
```

### 📋 **Sample Response:**
```
🌲🔥 PINE RIDGE WILDFIRE - SITUATION OVERVIEW

🚨 Current Status: ACTIVE - MULTIPLE ZONES
📊 Alert Level: EXTREME
🔥 Fire Size: 15,750 acres burned
🎯 Containment: 25% contained

👥 Human Impact:
• Total Affected: 25 people
• Severe Injuries: 7
• Evacuated Safely: 6
• Casualties: 4

🏠 Structures:
• Threatened: 450
• Destroyed: 85

👨‍🚒 Response:
• Firefighters: 380
• Aircraft: 12
```

## 🎮 **HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM**

### 🚀 **Quick Start:**
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd "C:\Users\PC\OneDrive\Bureau\CERIST\web2py\applications\eden\private"

# Run the Forest Fire Emergency Agent
python final_forest_fire_agent.py
```

### 💡 **Usage Tips:**
1. **Ask Natural Questions**: Use plain English, don't worry about technical terms
2. **Be Specific**: "Show me evacuation status" vs. "what's happening"
3. **Explore Different Areas**: Fire status, evacuees, resources, locations
4. **Use Commands**: Type 'quit' to exit, 'clear' to reset
